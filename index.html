                <h1>MY GOALS FOR THE NEXT 2 YEARS IN THE TECH FIELD</h1>
            </header>

            <div class="my-goals">
                <p>My tech goals for the next 2 years are two-faced. I want to build skills in UX design and UX engineering (frontend development).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the next 2 years, I will be an engineering student in her penultimate year so I'd have to find an internship placement. My aim for that IT period is to have built my development skills to the point where getting placement at a place of high standards would not be an issue. A place like Google would be nice but I particularly have my eye on Duolingo, I just love how user-friendly and interactive their UX is!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Asides getting a nice IT placement, developing my design and skills over the next 2 years would enable me to generate my own income as a student. I'd like to start freelancing on platforms like Fiverr or Upwork.
                </p>

                <h2>How exactly do I plan on acheiving these goals of mine?</h2>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in the HNG Internship under the Frontend Development Team. I am certain that upon completion of this internship, I will be more confident in my frontend development skills and my ability to network with people. I am taking the Google User Experience Design course which will give me the needed foundational knowledge I'll need for a career in UX design.</p>

                Beyond the next 2 years, I hope to have a proper career in a niche I will create for myself, one that involves the full creation of the frontend of a mobile or web environment.
